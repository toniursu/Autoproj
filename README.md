Hello everyone!
I am going to present to you my final project realised during QA Software Engineer course.
In this project I used the site [https://trupathebrothers.ro/](url).
Based on this site I realised some functional testing. In the one hand, I verified the function of some buttons from header and on the another hand, I verified the social media buttons.
Programming language: Java
IDE: Eclipse 
Tools: Selenium API, TestNG.# Autoproj
